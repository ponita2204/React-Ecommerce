    <h1 class="text-2xl font-semibold">About</h1>
    <p>
    <h2 class="font-semibold uppercase">Introduction</h2>
    <p>The Royal University of Phnom Penh (RUPP), founded in 1960, has undergone a series of transformations to become
      the leading national university in Cambodia. Other transformations are still happening. In the last five years,
      for example, Rupp has made considerable progresses in many areas including organizational structure, institutional
      governance, capacity building, infrastructure development, research, teaching and learning, curriculum
      development, and quality assurance. These achievements have encouraged RUPP management and faculty to strive
      harder to implement the institutional reform and achieve development goals.</p>
    <p>Looking towards the future, Rupp will grasp opportunities and assume a key role in driving Cambodia’s
      socio-economic development through the creation of human capital and the provision of quality research, training
      and community service. Rupp aspires to contribute to the achievement of the 2030 and 2050 national development
      goals of the Royal Government of Cambodia as well as the higher education vision of the Ministry of Education,
      Youth, and Sport.</p>
    <p>Against this backdrop, this Strategic Plan 2019-2023 has been developed to guide Rupp in realizing its
      development vision and goals for the next five years. It will serve as a roadmap for the university to orient its
      focus and for its sub-units to devise their own action plans accordingly. The strategic plan will move Rupp closer
      to assuming its place among other national universities in the ASEAN region as a center for intellectual and
      cultural development.</p>

    <h2 class="font-semibold uppercase">History</h2>
    <p>The Royal University of Phnom Penh first opened its doors as the Royal Khmer University on January 13, 1960, with
      a National Institute of Judicial and Economic Studies, a Royal School of Medicine, a National School of Commerce,
      a National Pedagogical Institute, a Faculty of Letters and Human Sciences, and a Faculty of Science and
      Technology. The language of instruction during this period was French.</p>

    <p> With the establishment of the Khmer Republic, the Royal Khmer University became the Phnom Penh University.
      Between 1965 and 1975 the university consisted of the Ecole Normale Supérieure, the Faculties of Letters and
      Humanities, Science, Pharmacy, Law and Economics, Medicine and Dentistry, Commerce, Pedagogy and the Language
      Institute.</p>


    <p> Between 1975 and 1979, the Khmer Rouge regime forced the cessation of formal education. Schools and universities
      were closed and destroyed, and teaching services decimated. Along with all other educational institutions in
      Cambodia, Phnom Penh University ceased to function during this time. The Khmer Rouge targeted the educated, and
      many of the University’s faculty members were killed. Of the educated people who survived the regime, few chose to
      remain in Cambodia once its borders reopened. Deserted for almost five years, the campus became another victim of
      the grim period during the Pol Pot regime.</p>
    <p> In 1980, the Ecole Normale Supérieure reopened, again teaching predominantly in French. The following year saw
      the opening of the Institute of Foreign Languages (IFL), initially training students to become Vietnamese and
      Russian language teachers. Both colleges focused on training students to become teachers, thus rebuilding the
      education system within Cambodia. </p>

    <p> In 1988, the Ecole Normale Supérieure merged with the IFL to create Phnom Penh University. In 1996, the
      university underwent its final change of name, becoming the Royal University of Phnom Penh.</p>
    <p>During the past decade, the University has continued to grow and now includes the Faculty of Science, Faculty of
      Social Sciences and Humanities, and the Institute of Foreign Languages. New departments and degree programs are
      developed regularly to keep up with the changing needs of Cambodian society. In keeping with its commitment to
      higher education, RUPP began to develop postgraduate degrees at a Masters level since 2001.</p>

                capacity of the EU- HEIs which have qualified academic personnel with great expertise on the field of
                education and implementation of EU projects. The EU-HEIs have contributed to the design of a project
                that has feasible goals. Additionally, the Asian HEIs have assessed the need and challenges of
                educational reform in their countries and region and how the skills should meet the needs of the labor
                market as well as the challenges of the globalized world.</li>

              Effective 15 may 2020
            </p>
            <p>Media is an important stakeholder in regard to societies reaching the goals of development-both as a
              contributor and a beneficiary. Notwithstanding, the Communication and media studies curriculum in the
              Asian HEIs seem to not successfully match with the skills required for effective sustainable development
              reporting in order to delivery the 2030 Agenda. The new courses will respond to the need for modernization
              of curricula in journalism and media reporting in the PC-HEIs, the need for journalist education with
              focus on sustainable development as well as the need for strong journalistic and pluralistic media system
              and the process of sustainable development. The curriculum content is designed to install the skills and
              level of data literacy necessary to produce both short data stories on a deadline as well as longer
              in-depth stories that explain underlying development challenges facing the region through data and digital
              storytelling. By choosing what is in a story, how the story is told, and the diversity of stories,
              journalists and editors have the capacity to enhance or limit the information people will use to form
              opinions and make decisions. Specifically, the objective pursued is in department of Media and
              Communication of Faculty of Social Science and Humanities of RUPP.</p>

              ANGEL Effective :15 Jan 2021
            </p>

            <p>A creation of strong network for green entrepreneurship and transformational leadership can be a catalyst
              for innovation and development as well as sustainable transformation (EU, ASEAN, UNDP, UNESCO, OECD).
              ANGEL aims to build the capacity necessary in eleven ASEAN Universities for balancing the high potential
              economic growth and innovation in the partner countries with their lack of capacities in green
              entrepreneurship as well as resolving entrenched issues and challenges of poverty, low quality jobs in the
              informal sector, digital divide and leadership gaps.</p>
            <p>Its objectives are:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>to address green entrepreneurship and transformational leadership and social innovation challenges.
                The ASEAN nations involved in this ANGEL project is at the lower spectrum of innovation, high-tech
                sectors and effective sanitation. Still, they have developed aspirations to improve living conditions by
                moving from a subsistence agricultural economy to commercial-based farming as well as high-based
                technology and energy. This is where ANGEL aims to create a difference in supporting such transition
                economies in Lao PDR, Vietnam and Cambodia.</li>
              <li>to build a high calibre network of future green entrepreneurial-leaders with effective and efficient
                style of management who could uphold ethics and good governance while able to connect with the
                local/regional and international market ecosystem with a multiplier effect in the ASEAN region. ANGEL
                takes issues of leadership as a prime concern in order to improve current institutional settings and
                professional practices which in some contexts are laden with cases of cronyism, corruptions and
                incompetence.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>Against the above general aims of ANGEL, the project specifically designs the following objectives in the
              hope to develop an innovative green entrepreneurial-leadership ecosystem that will foster:</p>
            <ul class="list-disc ml-6">
              <li>Guidance: an online guide will offer practical, personalized information for building and leading a
                green enterprise; a targeted training programme, complemented with personal coaching will support the
                creation of start-ups.</li>
              <li>Engagement: a university network will reach and mobilize both internal and external stakeholders
                through its ANGEL- Innovate Unit. Internal stakeholders would include faculty members, administrative
                staff, researchers, students and relevant external partners could be social entrepreneurs, start-ups and
                government agencies that relates to green entrepreneurship. The ANGEL- Innovate unit will orient
                learners to the process of design thinking; effective and responsible leadership, supporting grassroot
                green entrepreneurship and developing patent/copyright.</li>
              <li>Exchanges and sharing: the ANGEL-Hub will be a centre for the development of early-stage startups in
                green technologies, energy and sustainable development; the ANGEL-Site will provide all the information
                for the development and visibility of startups; the ANGEL-Community will connect all relevant parties in
                the University and external stakeholders in exchanging experiences and ideas.</li>
              <li>Support: the ANGEL-Enterprise team will have the mission to support and advance ANGEL in the long term
                through a. the development of expertise in the commercialization of Universities’ knowledge and
                technology, b. partnership-building with the external regional/national/international entrepreneurial
                ecosystem.</li>
